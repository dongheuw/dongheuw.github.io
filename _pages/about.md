I am a Ph.D. student in the [Database Group](https://db.cs.washington.edu/) of the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Magdalena Balazinska](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/magda). I also work closely with [Prof. Ranjay Krishna](http://www.ranjaykrishna.com/index.html) and [Prof. Alex Ratner](https://ajratner.github.io/).

My research focuses on the intersection of data management systems and machine learning. As machine learning continues to place immense computational demands, substantial investments have been made in both hardware and software infrastructure. Nevertheless, data management is increasingly becoming a bottleneck for numerous machine learning tasks. At the same time, DBMS builders are struggling to effectively leverage the exciting capabilities offered by machine learning infrastructure. My research aims to bring the two worlds together by designing novel **data management systems for ML workloads** and **incorporating ML infrastructure into DBMS architectures**.

<!-- My current projects focus on designing and building systems that efficiently support machine learning workloads, efficient database engines using machine learning infrastructure, as well as systems that efficiently manage video and image data. -->

Before UW, I obtained a Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Computer Science at Fudan University, where I worked with [Prof. Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/). I also worked with [Prof. Chenren Xu](http://soar.group/chenren/) at Peking University. In my younger years, I was a contestant in the [Olympiad in Informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics) and [ACM-ICPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest).

My probably out-of-date CV is available [here](https://dongheuw.github.io/files/DONGHE_CV.pdf).

:fire:**NEW**:fire: : **I am graduating in 2024 and open to research and engineering opportunities in industry.** Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my work!
